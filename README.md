# YaBDMOrganizer
This tool helps with editing BDM files for Xenoverse 2, which are responsible for all the damage information when linked to a BAC entry.

This is not a guide on what each entry means.  This is just a tool to make editing them easier.  For a more comprehensive guide to that, please refer to the [Skill/Moveset Editing Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18gaAbNCeJyTgizz5IvvXzjWcH9K5Q1wvUHTeWnp8M-E/edit#heading=h.88v2nbsynbav)

* Features include:
* Copying/Pasting/Adding/Deleting entries
* Find/Replace entries by value
* Shared clipboard between different instances of the BDM organizer
